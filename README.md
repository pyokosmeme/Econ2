# Economics 2.0: The Spin Transformer Economy

A theoretical physics research program mapping spin models, transformer architectures, and economics through a shared mathematical framework.

## Core Thesis

Sociophysics has mapped Ising models to classical economics. Recent work has mapped transformer neural networks to more complex spin systems. Composing these two maps yields a new question: if the Ising model gives you market economics, what kind of economics does the transformer spin Hamiltonian give you?

The answer appears to be an economy where value arises from thermodynamic gradients between heterogeneous agent populations — like a heat engine extracting work from a temperature difference.

## Project Status

**Phase 1: Complete.** The correspondence table between Ising features, transformer correspondents, and economic correspondents has been built (39 rows). Adversarial review and mesooptimizer audit have been conducted.

## Key Findings (Phase 1)

- **22 CLEAN correspondences** where Ising-to-transformer and Ising-to-economics maps compose straightforwardly
- **10 NOVEL entries** where transformer features bypass the Ising intermediary, requiring direct economic interpretation
- **5 TENSIONS** requiring theoretical resolution
- The strongest novel insight: data-dependent, asymmetric couplings — "pathological" in spin models — are fundamental in economics
- Temperature is defined as the softmax/logit scaling parameter (Bal + Sornette), operationally measurable from choice data
